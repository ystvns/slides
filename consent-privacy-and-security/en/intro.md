# Who Are We

- Nerds who care about people

# Why Should You Care?

- Privacy is the right to consent

> "Privacy is the right to withdraw consent, to only provide information to the people you want to provide it to, when you want to provide it. Privacy is consent.

-- Sarah Jamie Lewis, _Queer Privacy_

- **Autonomy/independence depends on consent**
- **Privacy depends on security**; there is no privacy without security
- The proper use of **encryption is the best way to guarantee security**.

So, an understanding of encryption is important for protecting yourself and your autonomy

# "I've done nothing wrong so I've got nothing to hide"

- Imagine if we didn't use envelopes and all mail was written on postcards
- **Widespread use of encryption normalizes privacy and security**...
- ... and so it normalizes consent and autonomy

# Okay cool, but what is encryption?

- Scrambling the contents of a message + generating a key that can unscramble it
- The only way to unscramble the message is by having/knowing/being the key
- The scrambled message (or *cipher*) should not give away anything about the original message (or *plaintext*)

# Our Framework

## Risk assessment

* Who are you worried about, specifically?

## Harm reduction

* What can we do about it?
* What are the limitations of our defenses?

## Technical guidance

* We'll help you understand and use helpful tools

# Risk assessment

## Context

- Different people face different threats
- Adding context can keep us focused and prevent getting overwhelmed

## Threat modeling

- **Who** might wish to cause you harm?
- **How** would they go about doing it?
- **What can you do** to stop them?

# Who might cause us harm?

## Sticky Note exercise!

# Who might cause us harm?

## Examples of malicious actors

- An ex-partner
- The cops
- A parent
- A scammer
- A thief
- Corporations
- Governments

# Harm reduction - Low Hanging Fruit

## How digital attacks actually work

- Attackers will **always** try the easiest and/or cheapest method of attack
- Security works by making things more difficult and/or expensive for your attacker
- It's not all about computers, e.g. _social engineering_

## Examples of low hanging fruit

- A short, easy to guess password on your accounts or devices (or not having one... lol)
- A password that is reused everywhere
- Personal data on social media (including games and quizzes!)
- Private data that you give them, e.g. device passwords, sexy photos

# Technical guidance - disclaimer

## **Your Tools Are Only As Good As You Are**

- For example, no app can protect you if you give away your password

- Info out in the world is basically impossible to regain control of

- Always take care to prevent info getting out in the first place

- Offline stuff matters too!

## Security Planner & Surveillance Self-Defense

* Security Planner gives personalized security device based on your threat model
* https://securityplanner.org/
* Surveillance Self Defense has basic info and helpful tool guides for safer online commmunication

## Encrypted messaging!

- Ideally: **Signal**
- Less ideal: WhatsApp, Telegram
- Never use: SMS/MMS (at least for private chats)

## Passphrase managers!

- KeePass XC, others

## 2-Factor Authentication!

- Makes it much harder for an attacker to get into your account with just a password
- Enable it on at least your email and social media accounts

## Stick around and we'll help you get set-up!
